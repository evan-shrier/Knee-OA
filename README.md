To install the necessary MATLAB app to use the software, run KAM_GUI.mlappinstall

The program can be run exclusively from the FinalFunc script, as long as KAM_GUI.mlapp is within the folder

KAM_Output.mat and KAM_RawData.mat will be automatically updated and saved after each entry, but please push the changes so that they will be included on everyones computer.
